# Project
Modelling emissions of HFCs from spray foam

Foam_Model.py - containg the foam emission model.
Model_Fitting.py - code which fits the model to the TD and BU models.
Model_Plotting.py - creates plots of outputs of model
Model_Output.ipynb - notebook showing all model outputs
global_vs_sector_emissions.py - adapted code to read data from TD and BU data
data - contains outputs for TD model
GasEmissionsData_01.xlsx - contains output of BU model
GWP.csv - contains GWP of HFCs
HFC_info.csv - containd information about HFCs
